Overview Data Science Projects

# Project 1: Credit Card Approval Classification (link here!)
* Trained and evaluated a binary classification model to predict the suitability of a credit card applicant based on personal data.
* Worked with real-world data including data of ~36,000 applicant IDs.
* Used EDA and Vintage Analysis to illustrate the payment behaviour of the applicants and assign a label to each applicant ID {'good', 'bad'}.
* Used SMOTE as data synthesization technique to balance the classes represented in the dataset.
* Trained and evaluated different classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) using k-fold cross validation.
* Reviewed model performance by looking at important metrics such as confusion matrix, F1-Score, ROC Curve/ROC AUC score.

# Project 2: Deep Learning for Electric Motor Temperature Estimation (linke here!)
* Built linear ML models as well as Deep Neural Networks to predict the temperature of motor components inside a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor.
