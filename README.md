# Niklas Data Science Portfolio


# [Project 1: Credit Card Approval Classification](https://github.com/nikprt/Creditcard_Approval_Classification)
* Trained and evaluated a binary classification model to predict the suitability of a credit card applicant based on personal data.
* Worked with real-world data including data of ~36,000 applicant IDs.
* Used EDA and Vintage Analysis to illustrate the payment behaviour of the applicants and to assign a label to each applicant ID {'good', 'bad'}.
* Used SMOTE as oversampling technique to balance the classes represented in the dataset.
* Trained and evaluated different classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) using k-fold cross validation.
* Reviewed model performances by looking at important metrics such as confusion matrix, F1-Score, ROC Curve/ROC AUC score.

# [Project 2: Deep Learning for Electric Motor Temperature Estimation](https://github.com/nikprt/PMSM_Temperature_Estimation)
* Built linear ML models as well as Deep Neural Networks to predict the temperature of motor components inside a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor.
* Used EDA to analyze the dynamics of the measurement profiles.
* Used feature engineering and correlation analysis to create additional features and measure their linear relationships.
* Computed weighted moving averages to adapt to the timeseries data for training.
* Trained and evaluated Linear Regressors and Feedforward Neural Networks for the permanent magnet temperature prediction.

# [Project 3: Crop Yield Analysis
* Used ML techniques such as linear regression, K-means clustering and K-Nearest-Neighbors to predict a current risk of crop yield losses
* Fitted a linear model on weather and geospatial data related features (average air temperatures, precipitaions etc.)
* Used clustering for grouping the data into high and lower risk data groups
* Used a classification algorithm (KNN) to assign the ML prediction to one of the clusters
